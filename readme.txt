1. gete.py   get the total energy from the OUTCAR(energy output) file

2. sameconcen.py get the number of different elements from CONTCAR(geometry optimization output) file and use this later to test the accuracy of this code

3. num_bonds.py   get the nearest number of different types of bonds ("error" bonds: also includes the bonds between 1st and 3rd layer)

4. errorbondnumber.py   calculate the number of "error" bonds for C type structure

5. findtype.py examine different structure types (a small amount of structures belong to B type)

6. debug.py  calculate the number of "error" bonds for B type structure
